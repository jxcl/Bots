In this game there are three types of bots: black, red, and green. Red and
green bots can capture other bots, but black bots cannot. Both the red and
green bots attempt to capture all of the other bots on the field. The game
is over when all bots are of one color.

Red bots cannot move, but they can capture 5 other bots each. 

Green bots can move, but they can only capture 3 other bots each.

The brightness of the bot is how many captures the bot has left. The dimmer
the bot the more captures it has made. The number of captures it has made is
reset every time it itself is captured.
